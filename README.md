## Source for jtt.coffee

[jtt.coffee](https://jtt.coffee) is my personal website mainly used for coffee related repository.

### Some boring info:

* The website is hosted on a VPS with Cloudflare set up as the CDN.
* The design looks similar to [Notion](https://notion.so) site, because it *was*.
* It is converted into a static site using [Notablog](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog).
